##  Functionality

1. Track gifts for different people
2. CRUD functionality per person (recipient)
3. CRUD functionality per gift
4. Track expenses 
    - Maintain total budget/expenses
        - User can enter the total amount that they're willing to spend
        - App will notify user if expenses exceed current budgeting limit
    - Maintain expenses per person
        - Each person can have multiple gifts
        - Total expense per person will be a total of the price each gift associated to the person
5. Tracking Gifts
    - Users can check of a gift, implying that the gift has been bought
    - Once a user has checked off all gifts, the recipient of these gifts will be checked off as well implying that the user has finished purchasing gifts for the recipient.
6. Built in Christmas Countdown (or other holidays?)
    - Will display on the home view
7. Wish list of gift items that the user would like to recieve
    - Ideally, should be shareable via iMessage
8. Gift exchange functionality (if time)
    - User can create a gift exchange
    - Add a list of people
    - Randomly select a pair of two people to buy gifts for each other

## Third Party APIs

3. Projected Spendings
4. Current expense (total amount user will currently be spending)
5. Wish list?

Keep views simple and precise. Total number of views should be no more than 5. Will make use of table views to list each recipient and another table view to represent gifts associated to recipient.

HomeViewController: Summary of expenses

RecipientViewController: List of all recipients (giftee)

RecipientDetailViewController: Display Recipient information along with gifts belonging to them

LoginViewController

Todo:

WishListViewController

SettingsViewController

GiftExchangeViewController?

CountdownViewController
